📚 Dictionary API (Unofficial) – GitHub Edition
Welcome to my unofficial GitHub-hosted version of the open-source dictionary API from dictionaryapi.dev.
This repo includes:
api_code.html → The actual API endpoint logic (static, client-side)
example.html → A simple demo showing how to call the API
Uses 0 backend, 0 servers, 0 dollars. Just vibes + HTML.

🚀 What This Project Does
This project basically re-hosts the Dictionary API in a GitHub-friendly way, so anyone can:
Query definitions, phonetics, parts of speech, etc.
Learn how to fetch API data using pure HTML + JS
Copy/paste the example into their own projects
It’s perfect for beginners learning APIs, or for small projects that need simple dictionary lookups.

📁 Files
api_code.html
This is the file that shows how to call the dictionary API.
You can open it directly in your browser or use it as a template.
example.html
A clean demo showing the actual fetch request + UI.
This is the file to check if you want a working example immediately.

🧪 How to Use
Open example.html in any browser.
Type a word (like "hello", "technology", "vortex", go crazy 👀).
Click Search.
See results instantly — definitions, pronunciation, phonetics, and more.
All client-side. No API key needed.

🌐 Original API Credit
The data source is from the amazing free project:

💡 Why This Repo Exists
To help beginners understand how REST APIs work
To provide a fully static, GitHub-hosted API example
To give devs an easy copy/paste template
Because building things is more fun than scrolling TikTok 😌
